This project was built to bring a stateful, reactive front end to a dotnet core api.

GraphQL plus Apollo Hooks makes querying a total breeze.

Styled components are making styling more declarative, and conditional sttyling of the components is much easier and readable.

The backend is meant to feel familiar for my organization, with tools like Dotnet and Entity making up the basis of the data layer, but with the added benefit of GraphQL resolvers for front end fun.
